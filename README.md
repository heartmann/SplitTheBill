This repository contains the source code and resources of the Android app [Split the Bill](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.dev.hartmann.valentin.splitthebill).

## Description
'Split the Bill' helps you manage payments with your friends more easily.

You and your friends are at the cinema and to make things go faster at the counter, two or three of you put together their money and pay the tickets and snacks. Then the question arises: Who owes who how much?
That's where 'Split the Bill' comes into play! Simply enter what each one has ordered and already paid and the app shows you how to become even.
